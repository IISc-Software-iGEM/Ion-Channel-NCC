# How to calculate the electrostatic potential of a protein using APBS

We have mainly three options for doing this.

1. Using the APBS web server
2. Using Pymol
3. Using Command line apbs

## Using the APBS web server

It is very straight forward. You covert pdb2pqr (automatically done) with specified parameters and then submit the job. You will get the results soon.
<br>You can download the files created for your job which may be of random names.

## Using Pymol

For Pymol you can easily visualize the electrostatic potential of a protein. Just use the APBS plugin in Pymol. When the job is done, click the `+` sign and on the map file,
go to Action -> Gradient -> Volume -> Default, this will give you the electrostatic potential field lines.
<br>
_Note:_

1. Go to the APBS configurations and set parameters. This is really important, avoid blind calculations.
2. Change the name of the temporary file created by Pymol to a more meaningful name and a better location and save it. This will give you the file which was used
   for the visualisations.

## Using Command line apbs

For Linux download the 2 Terminal toold

```bash
sudo apt-get install apbs pdb2pqr
```

This will download both of them which you can confirm using `apbs --help` or `pdb2pqr --help`.

### PDB2PQR

Once this is done, you can use pdb2pqr inside the terminal. Good thing, it provides lots of options to set parameters.

```bash
# Example for Usage
pdb2pqr --ff=AMBER --with-ph=7.0 --apbs-input=protein.in protein.pdb protein.pqr # protein.pqr may not be present before
```

For a better example case, as followed in the web-server, we will run the below command with more options-

```bash
pdb2pqr --ff=AMBER --apbs-input=protein.in --keep-chain --whitespace --drop-water --titration-state-method=propka --with-ph=7 protein.pdb protein.pqr
```

This is a really powerfull command for apbs, this does the following-

1. Creates the pqr file with no-water, chain-id, -propka + ph=7, whitespace(for better looks)<br>The pqr fill contains only atom information and is independent of any parametric value.
2. Create the .in file for apbs on its own, which is better since it judges the grid size and other factors on its own. We can edit it as well for any parametric changes.
   <br>
   The outputs are `protein.pqr`, `protein.in` with only input as `protein.pdb`.

## APBS calculations

For APBS, it has to be put in a file, which you make. The file should have a format(.in) where you mention the protein name and the parameters.
<br>For example, the file may look like this:

```
read mol pqr protein.pqr  # Read the protein structure
end
# Electrostatics section
elec mg-auto
dime 481 481 481  # Set grid size (e.g., 97 97 161)
cglen 481 481 481    # Define the box size (e.g., 160 160 230)
fglen 400 400 400 # Define a smaller box around the protein (e.g., 130 130 200)
mol 7yg0.pqr # which molecule this is running for. You can have many `elec` for each mol
cgcent mol 1                   # Center the grid on the molecule
fgcent mol 1                   # Center the focus box on the molecule
lpbe

bcfl sdh  # Read docs for this
# Ion definition (optional, adjust ion types and concentrations as needed)
ion 1 0.100 2.0  # 100 mM Na+ ion
ion -1 0.100 2.0 # 100 mM Cl- ion

# Define dielectric constants
pdie 4.0        # Solute dielectric
sdie 80.00      # Solvent dielectric

# Charge discretization and surface options
chgm spl0       # Linear charge discretization
srfm smol       # Smoothed molecular surface
srad 1.4        # Solvent probe radius
swin 0.3        # Spline window (not used)

# Additional options (adjust as needed)
sdens 10.0      # Sphere density
temp 298.15     # Temperature
#gamma 0.105     # Apolar coefficient

# Output options
calcenergy total   # Total- calculate energies
calcforce total    # Total- calculate forces
write qdens dx qdens # Write out charge density
write pot dx pot   # Write out electrostatic potential

end quit
```

**Note**:

1. All keywords mentioned here are required (ion is optional)
2. mg-auto -> This automatically sets up and performs a string of single-point PBE calculations to "focus" on a region of interest (binding site, etc.) in a system. It is basically an automated version of mg-manual designed for easier use.
3. You need not write this file if you are using `--apbs-input=protein.in` flag while running pdb2pqr command. All values will be automatically set and we can `write` what files we want.
   <br>
   This you write a python file which puts various file names in pdb, you have a set of parameters set for all, and then run-

```bash
apbs protein.in
```

This will give you two files called protein_qdens.dx and protein_pot.dx(or similar naming scheme may apply) which can be visualized using VMD or Pymol.<br>
If we print energies on the command line, then we must calculate it in `ELEC` block. Do not ignore Terminal printed text.
